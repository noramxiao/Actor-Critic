# Actor-Critic
Integrated RL algorithms with latent cause inference for continual learning. Work done with postdoc Sashank Pisupati and Prof. Yael Niv at Princeton.

Simulated a grid world with obstacles and rewards, navigated by an actor-critic agent (both value and policy representations). The agent learns various latent states, allowing it to segregate learning for continual learning. Our work has applications in psychiatry â€” understanding failures in human learning.
